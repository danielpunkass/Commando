# Commando

This is an interesting project I found at http://www.maccommando.com/Downloads.html

The goal is to formalize a "CIF" file format for specifying user interfaces to command line tools.

The name Commando comes from an old MPW (Macintosh Programmer's Workshop) functionality of the same name.

In MPW you could add an ellipsis character to any command, e.g. "lsâ€¦" to bring up a UI for the options to the command.

This project endeavors to add similar functionality but you have to invoke it as e.g. "cmdo ls".
